# Regression
Regression-Based Modeling:

1) Dynamic Pricing of Used Cell Phones (ReCell_Phone_Pricing): <br>
Linear, multi-regression modeling, has been adopted for devising an ML-based strategy for dynamic pricing of refurbished
cell phones and tablets, while device attributes such as year of release, camera resolution, brand, operating
system and 4G/5G capability have been used as regressors.  <br>
Key tools: Multi-Regression, Linear Regression Assumptions, Statistical Tests <br>
Libraries: scikit-learn, statsmodels.api, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, pandas  


1) Prediction of Annual Turnover of Restaurants (ReCell_Phone_Pricing): <br>
Linear regression along with regularization techiniques (ridge regression and LASSO) has been leveraged to build an ML model
capable of foreecasting the revenue generation of Indian-based restaurants using their attributes such as years since opening,
social media popularity, location, available amenities (e.g., parking, live music or live sports), hygiene, responsiveness and
wait time. <br>
Key tools: Multi-Regression, Shrinkage Methods, LASSO, Ridge Regression <br>
Libraries: scikit-learn, statsmodels.api, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, pandas
